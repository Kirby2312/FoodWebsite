		<p id="paragraph">Curry is a variety of dishes originating in the Indian subcontinent. It uses a combination of spices or herbs, usually including ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies. In southern India, curry leaves from the curry tree are also an integral ingredient.[1] Turmeric is the main spice in curry, having a warm, bitter taste and is used to flavor or color curry powder, mustard, butter, and cheese. Curry is generally prepared as a sauce.

		There are many varieties of dishes called "curries". For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. [4] Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th Century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British colonial government and army returning to Britain.</p>
